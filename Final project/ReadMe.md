# Final project of Database course

Conducted data extraction from raw files available on the website of the Max Planck Institute (https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/databases-and-information-systems/research/yago-naga/yago/downloads/), using Python.

Employed Python and MySQL to preprocess and cluster the extracted TSV files, ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the data.

Designed and developed a 3NF database to efficiently store, manage and retrieve the processed data, optimizing the data accessibility and analysis.
